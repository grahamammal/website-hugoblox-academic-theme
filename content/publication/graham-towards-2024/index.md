abstract: We address the goal of conducting inference about a smooth finite-dimensional
  parameter by utilizing individual-level data from various independent sources. Recent
  advancements have led to the development of a comprehensive theory capable of handling
  scenarios where different data sources align with, possibly distinct subsets of,
  conditional distributions of a single factorization of the joint target distribution.
  While this theory proves effective in many significant contexts, it falls short
  in certain common data fusion problems, such as two-sample instrumental variable
  analysis, settings that integrate data from epidemiological studies with diverse
  designs (e.g., prospective cohorts and retrospective case-control studies), and
  studies with variables prone to measurement error that are supplemented by validation
  studies. In this paper, we extend the aforementioned comprehensive theory to allow
  for the fusion of individual-level data from sources aligned with conditional distributions
  that do not correspond to a single factorization of the target distribution. Assuming
  conditional and marginal distribution alignments, we provide universal results that
  characterize the class of all influence functions of regular asymptotically linear
  estimators and the efficient influence function of any pathwise differentiable parameter,
  irrespective of the number of data sources, the specific parameter of interest,
  or the statistical model for the target distribution. This theory paves the way
  for machine-learning debiased, semiparametric efficient estimation.
